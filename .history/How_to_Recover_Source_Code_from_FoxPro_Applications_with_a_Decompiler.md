A FoxPro decompiler is a program that can analyze a FoxPro compiled module or executable and extract the original source code from it. This can be useful for debugging, reverse engineering, or restoring your work. However, not all FoxPro decompilers are created equal. Some may only support certain versions of FoxPro, some may not handle encrypted or branded modules, and some may not produce accurate or readable code.
